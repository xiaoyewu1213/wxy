The original novel 'The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: The Notes 1' is a fiction written in a diary format. It tells a story about 7 teenage boys who live in the darkness getting to know each other. Everyone is struggling and trying to live with hurt and abandonment from life. Their fate seem to be related with each other as one of the boys has the power to turn back time and is trying to relive the events to save all the others. Where will destiny finally lead them to?

"Those days were gone and would never come again."

I finished this translation in 2019 on my own. If you have interest, have a read!
