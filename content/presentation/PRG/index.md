The presentation is based on Chapter 31 Phonological Theory and Computational Modelling from The Oxford History of Phonology. It shows how computational modelling develops along with phonological theory and in turn how the models contribute to the field of phonology. The milestones in the history of phonology include Generative Grammar, Autosegmental Phonology, OT and so on. I will show how does computational modelling develop and undergo modifications from the earliest finite-state linear models to incoporate with non-linear representations and constraint-based grammar. It opens up a lot of possibilities for us to explore how can we learn from computational modelling to cast light on phonology.
